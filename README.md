To use this theme, do what you would do to install Upsilon/Omega with the terminal, clean by using `make clean` and run the following command by modifying slot A or B and entering your username : 
```bash
$ make epsilon.onboarding.A_flash OMEGA_USERNAME="Your Name" THEME_NAME=kappa_light THEME_REPO=https://github.com/KappaCFW/Kappa-Theme -j$(nproc)
```
Boom, your done ! Enjoy your brand new theme :)

__(Note that the title in the title bar will be Upsilon and not Kappa!)__
